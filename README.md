Overview of the Project

Project- Predictive modelling using inear regression

Objective-Implementing a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. Spliting the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set.

Key Activites- 
1)Data Cleaning- Ensuring the dataset doesn't have any duplicated or missing values 
2)Feature Selection- Selection of features to find their realtion.
3)Training model- With the feature extracted the model is then trained 
4)Data Visualition- Creating visulization to get better understanding of the dataset
